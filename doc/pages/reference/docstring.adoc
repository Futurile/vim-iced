=== Docstring

There are two ways (explicit and implicit) to refer to a var's docstring.

The explicit way is to execute one of the following commands.

[cols="30,20,50"]
|===
| Command | Default key mapping | Description

| {help_html}#%3AIcedDocumentPopupOpen[IcedDocumentPopupOpen]
| {plug_iced_document_popup_open}
| Shows the docstring for the var under the cursor in a popup window.

| {help_html}#%3AIcedDocumentOpen[IcedDocumentOpen]
|
| Opens a <<document_buffer>>, and shows the docstring in it.

The implicit way is the Auto Document feature.
This feature will automatically display a one-line documentation string on the right of cursor line.
This will be done by `CursorHold` and `CursorHoldI` auto command.

{help_html}#g%3Aiced_enable_auto_document[g:iced_enable_auto_document] is a configuration to enable auto document feature.
