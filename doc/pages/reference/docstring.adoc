=== Docstring

There are two ways (explicit and implicit) to refer var's docstring.

The explicit way is executing commands such as follows.

[cols="30,20,50"]

| Command | Default key mapping | Description

| {help_html}#%3AIcedDocumentPopupOpen[IcedDocumentPopupOpen]
| {plug_iced_document_popup_open}
| Show docstring for the var under the cursor in popup window

| {help_html}#%3AIcedDocumentOpen[IcedDocumentOpen]
